      <li>
        Held Ball: In the case of a 'Held Ball,' the initial attacking team will continue possession, unless they 'travel,' or a 'foul' occurs. Judges and assistants will ensure that this is a fair event.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoring: 1 point for penalty shot, two points for regular shot and three
        points when a shot is made with both of the player's feet behind the
        three point line.
      </li>
      <li>
        Injuries and Fighting: Injuries and fights will be resolved by the 'Main
        Referee.'
      </li>
      <li>
        According to NBA rules, the attacking team has 24 seconds to attempt a shot, or a whistle will be called and the defensive team will gain possession.
      </li>
      <li>
